30.11.2009
==========

- Improved the captest utility to be able to set control values, input and output connectors and capture framerate.
- bugfix: Mac OS X compilation problem due to missing 64 bit QuickTime.


08.10.2009
==========

- bugfix: setting format params fails sometimes for v4l2-devices.


05.06.2009
==========

Releasing version 0.1.8 of avcap.

- This release contains 2 bug-fixes of the Mac OS X backend only:
  1. using undefined type STANDARD_ID_T in FormatManager.h
  2. calling DeviceDescriptor::close() and CaptureDevice::close() in a circular way

22.04.2009
==========

Releasing version 0.1.7 of avcap.

- bugfix: Building applications with the prebuild windows libraries not possible 
(see the README, section: Using the prebuild windows libraries)
- bugfix: Possible Null-Pointer for V4L2-Control in Control-list.
- Modified CaptureDevice creation and memory management: The unique CaptureDevice object for a particular hardware
  must be obtained from DeviceDescriptor::getDevice() now. In order to create the object the method 
  DeviceDescriptor::open() must be called first. DeviceDescriptor::close() can then be called, if the device-object
  is not used anymore. The ownership of the device-object remains with the DeviceDescriptor, so  you must not delete it. 
  The open() and close() methods of the CaptureDevice are now superfluous and have been omitted. 
  The same is true for DeviceDescriptor::createDevice()

09.01.2009
==========

Releasing version 0.1.6 of avcap.

- Implemented FormatManager::getFramerate() and setFramerate() for the DS_FormatManager (thanks Dao77)
  This relates only to the Win32-implementation of the library.

14.11.2008
==========

Releasing version 0.1.4 of avcap.

- bugfix: exiting process on erroneous AV/C device initialization. This is not the expected behaviour for a library.

08.10.2008
==========

- moved remove/registerCaptureHandler to CaptureManager base class
- added CaptureManager::getCaptureHandler()
- changed CaptureManager::removeCaptureHandler()-signature (omitted dispensable parameter *handler)

02.10.2008
==========

Releasing version 0.1.2 of avcap.

==========

Releasing version 0.1.2 of avcap.

- bugfix: query resolutions for ivtv in V4L2_FormatManager.cpp
- bugfix: check device index in captest.cpp

17.06.2008 
==========

Releasing version 0.1 of avcap.

Currently implemented backends for operating systems/capture API's are:

- Linux: Video4Linux, Video4Linux2, IEEE1394 AV/C DV-Cams

- Win32: DirectShow

The release contains the platform independent source, a small test application (captest)
and precompiled binaries for win32
